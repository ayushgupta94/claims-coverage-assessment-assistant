"""Tool: fraud_risk_scoring

A transparent, weighted heuristic scorer -- explicitly a POC-level
implementation, not a trained ML fraud model. Each signal contributes a
documented weight to a 0-1 risk score, and every triggered signal is named
in the output. Swapping in a trained classifier later wouldn't require
changing this tool's interface (claim_id in, FraudRiskResult out).

Takes only `claim_id`, mirroring coverage_rule_tool: the tool looks up the
claim, its issued policy (for inception_date), and its claim history
itself rather than trusting the LLM to reproduce them. Product-version
data isn't needed here -- fraud signals are about timing/amount/frequency,
not policy wording or exclusions.
