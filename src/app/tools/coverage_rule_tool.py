"""Tool: coverage_rule_check

A deterministic, auditable rule engine -- deliberately *not* an LLM call.
Coverage eligibility needs to be traceable to explicit business rules, not
model inference: an insurer needs to be able to point to *why* a claim was
rejected. The agent calls this tool and treats its output as ground truth.

Rule evaluation is split by where the data actually lives:
  - exclusions + waiting_period_days come from PolicyProductVersion
    (shared, product-level rules)
  - sum_insured + inception_date come from IssuedPolicy
    (customer-specific values)
  - claim_type + amount + incident_date come from the Claim itself

Takes only `claim_id` -- the tool looks up the claim, its issued policy,
and that policy's product version itself, rather than requiring the LLM to
reproduce that data in its tool call arguments.
